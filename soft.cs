/* im still unsure how to dev this so i got a couple options
1. simple terminal application as everyone else, maybe make fanciers with pages that clear out the screen every time and has a look trough pages thing with a list
2. make a web app with .net so its nice and fancy
3. make it so when launching you have the option whether to run on web or terminal

Decided to make text based very simple first in abt a hour, if i got time and willpower will make a better version after.
